#Notes on Android

1. iOS specific settings bundle does not work on Android
2. react-native-start-io10 requires 4* okhttp version, react v0.63 provides 3.12 which is not compatible. There is a patch that force include the dependency to package. After upgrade to last react version this approach needs to be reevaluated and potentially removed
